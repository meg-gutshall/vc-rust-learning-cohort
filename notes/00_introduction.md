### The Rust Programming Language â€“ Introduction

- Rust gives programmers the best of both worlds: high-level ergonomics along with low-level control
- Rust's compiler works alongside the programmer to uncover issues in low-level code, including concurrency bugs, by simply refusing to compile the code
  - This is opposed to the extensive testing and review required by other languages to root out low-level code bugs
- Some Rust developer tools include:
  - Cargo: A dependency manager and build tool
  - Rustfmt: A formatting tool
  - The Rust Language Server: Powers IDE integration
- Rust helps to make concepts like operating systems development more accessible to newer programmers
- The Rust programming language is open source
